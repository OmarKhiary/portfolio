        In 2008, commissioned by the Philips business-unit up-market flat TV,
        WEBER Creatives produced the film Tango Démasqué. The assignment was to
        create a short film to demonstrate the range of possibilities of the
        Philips Aurea Ambilight series, for an audience of Philips retailers and
        prospects. The film Tango Démasqué was internationally awarded at the
        New York Festivals. “I can resist everything except temptation!” – Oscar
        Wilde once wrote. It was this famous quote which formed the inspiration
        for the concept of Tango Démasqué. In line with the overall marketing
        concept “seduction by light” of the Aurea TV, WEBER Creatives created a
        concept that emphasizes both the ideas of seduction and the light that
        gets emitted by the TV. It resulted in the story of a woman who walks
        into a bar and gets seduced while dancing the tango. The movement of the
        dancing couple combined with the light effects and colors reflecting on
        the surroundings accentuate the qualities of the Ambilight TV.

        The entire production was completed within a time-frame of only three
        months. The highlight of this production-process was a three-day shoot
        in Rotterdam, where the film was shot with an international crew.
        Careful preparations included the designing and building of the set,
        importing the Venetian masks from Venice and dancing lessons for the
        protagonists, even-though the close-ups of the tango dance steps were
        filmed with the help of stand-inns. The beautiful dresses by Lanvin and
        the luxurious jewelry by Lorenz Bäumer added to the exclusive and
        extravagant look and feel. The production was completely shot with
        Thomson Viper and Phantom HD cameras and the music were exclusively
        composed for this film.
